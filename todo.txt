SWEEPERCALL - ROADMAP

#6 - IMPLEMENT OMNIAUTH (should mixin well with sorcery - hopefully)
#8 - pretty bootstrap form validations
#13 - implement email notification cron in production
#14 - test mailer cron with 1000+ users at once, possibly add in a sleep or whatever so it doesn't die
#21 - move out confirmation job into a DJ queue, workers may not scale well without this.
#22 - implement delayed_job_web admin ** use resque instead
#38 - put the margin back in on the well class
#46 - logging
#49 - implement soft-delete on agent recordings
#53 - there may be an issue with the subscription page if a user takes a very long time to enter their information
#58 -  

CHANGES TO BE MADE BEFORE CHARGING PEOPLE (to make subscriptions work again)
A - remove before_create callback: set_active_subscription
B - update test for above (end of agent_spec)
C - 

COMPLETED
#7 - remove ugly curves from navbar
#27 - all phone numbers to string, then implement: @phone_number.gsub(/([-() ])/, '')
#24 - phone number validation problem
#19 - set up phone number validations. important to have the format twilio wants
#26 - finish custom validations (now using custom methods)
#29 - update phone verification to work with new outgoing_phone field
#31 - REGEXP for email validation 
#28 - implement an "outgoing email" field for agents which allows them to choose an outgoing email if they want (before_create callback for using their user email as default)
#16 - don't allow agents to have multiple active messages of a certain type
#30 - update phone/email to use outgoing_phone and outgoing_email on the agent model
#4 - error on new_person signup where if a user clicks on an empty form it breaks due to uuid.nil
#18 - set root to agent/person dashboard (on root: if current_user => #show)
#3 - make a profile for agents with stats we can gather on/for them
#9 - We have a choice on the current person model: kept as it is a person would be able to sign up but not make a notification until they enter their address. Or: force them to do it at signup
#1 - Set up users#create to correctly refresh either the new_person or new template depending on referrer
#40 - refector current_week method so we don't have to pass in current day and month
#37 - ping site from an ec2 instance or whatever to prevent heroku from dumping app out of memory
#20 - figure out task to change boolean for verified numbers
#45 - validate email on signup
#41 - database appears to be in a different timezone. after ~4pm starts saving at the wrong date
#44 - Remove notifications from edit
#47 - add tabs to agent#show
#48 - add person_id/user_id to admin backend
#35 - destroy recording from s3 when agent deletes it (or soft-delete)
#36 - destroy recordings from s3 when agent account is deleted (or implement soft-delete of agent account)
#23 - implement destroy recording after copy to amazon s3
#39 - get set_outgoing_email out of controller and into a callback if possible
#52 - implement stripe
#55 - set trial token
#17 - users#new_person uuid.nil? needs a master agent set up for when an agent cancels their account
#54 - stripe - allow a user to cancel/suspend their account
#51 - begins-on/ends-on date (subscriptions)
#50 - edit needs to go to show (agents/people) (for admins)
#56 - voice recording confirm message
#57 - fix length of layouts/messages flash message so it lines up with the notifications in agent#show

NEEDS TESTING
#15 - set mailer up to use agents from:email
#5 - when an admin deletes a user, it should also delete them from their current agent
#42 - Twilio client disables sound completely - SYSTEMWIDE - requires restart

PROBABLY WONT DO / HOLD OFF
#12 - make it so removing a person sets visible? = false, person retains their account
  - not doing this one because it is unlikely that a person will want to reinstate their account
#25 - move OutgoingCallerId list to a table so we don't have to query twilio api for this
  - just pinging the api for now
#10 - Add bottom bar (about 100px)
  - may need this later, don't now.
#2 - Test hidden/readonly fields w/ BURP suite
  - do last
#11 - set up checkboxes for notification weeks (see railscast on HABTM checkboxes)
  - will not behave
#33 - eventually we need to send out a verification message when a person changes their outgoing_email to verify that they are the owner of the email
  - holding off as this will take a few hours and most people will not exploit this (verification is already set up when they sign up for the account). for now it is disabled.
#34 - make sure we are using the correct email for Person (when customer changes email, they should still get email notifications)
  - see above, no longer pertinent

CANCELED
#43 - check out using or equals in the controller to set defaults
#32 - move twilio client into an initializer, dry up all instances of its use
- bad idea (timeout)
